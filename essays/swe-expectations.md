## First Engineering Experience 

Computers and electronic circuits have always interested me. The first real “engineering” project I completed was creating an automatic fish feeder. During the time, I was exposed to many engineering tools and concepts such as Fusion360 for 3D modeling and printing, programming Arduino microcontrollers, and building circuits to create a functioning product. Learning about the different electronic components and how to program C for the microcontroller is what drew me towards software engineering.


## The Learning Journey

Throughout my time as a Computer Engineering student, I have been exposed to a lot of software engineering. At times it can be overwhelming to think about what specific career path I’ll take as programming knowledge is applicable to many fields such as cybersecurity, game development, IoT development, web development, and embedded systems. However, I think this is the big appeal of software engineering, there are so many fields to choose from, giving lots of job opportunities.

## I Wanna Be SWE!

As ICS 314 continues, I look forward to gaining more knowledge in full stack development and competency with the different tools such as GitHub, ReactJS, Bootstrap, mongoDB, and Meteor. Along with the course, I hope to make time for myself to study other software concepts such as data structures and algorithms.
